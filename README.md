# LA-real-estate

In this repository you will find a dataset of around 8000 house listings from LA. These listings have been scraped from the website realtor.com

The aim of this project is to create a dashboard which will make some trends in the housing market apparent, such as the distribution of price across zip codes, the global distribution of prices, how they relate to the size of houses and the distribution of house sizes. 

Additionally the project includes a simple KNN Regression model used to predict a house's price, given some parameters.
